# Not-a-bot
Discord bot written in python using disnake
Not meant to be selfhosted

# Cogs
All of the commands reside in the `cogs` folder with the exception of help which is located in the `bot.py` file in `bot`  folder. 
Backend for the commands is located in `bot` and `utils` 

# Requirements
`requirements.txt` should have most if not all the packages needed to run this bot.
You still need outside programs such as a MySQL server set up for the bot to work.
